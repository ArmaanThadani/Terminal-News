            <img src = "bio_introduction">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Biometric authentication, once a staple of science fiction, has become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives. By leveraging unique physiological and behavioral traits, biometric systems offer a convenient and secure way to verify identity. However, as the use of biometrics grows, so do concerns about security and privacy. This article delves into the rise of biometric authentication technologies and the delicate balance between enhancing security and protecting privacy.

            <h2>What is Augmented Reality?</h2>
            <p>
                Biometric authentication is a security process that uses an individual’s unique biological traits to verify their identity. These traits can be physical, such as fingerprints, facial features, and iris patterns, or behavioral, such as voice recognition and gait analysis. Biometric systems compare captured data against stored templates to authenticate a user.

                <br><br>•	Fingerprint Recognition: Analyzes the unique patterns of ridges and valleys on a person’s fingertip.
                <br><br>•	Facial Recognition: Identifies individuals based on the geometric features of their face.
                <br><br>•	Iris Recognition: Uses the unique patterns in the colored ring of the eye.
                <br><br>•	Voice Recognition: Analyzes the unique characteristics of a person’s voice.
                <br><br>•	Behavioral Biometrics: Includes gait analysis, keystroke dynamics, and other behavior-based metrics.
            </p>
