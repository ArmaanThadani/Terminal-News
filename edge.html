            <h1>Edge Computing: Bringing Data Processing Closer to the Source</h1>
            <img src = "edge_introduction">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                As the volume of data generated by devices and applications continues to grow exponentially, traditional cloud computing models are being supplemented by edge computing. This technology offers a decentralized approach to data processing, where data is handled closer to its point of origin. This article explores the fundamentals of edge computing, its operational mechanisms, and its applications across various sectors.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src = "edge_explanation">
            <h2>What is Edge Computing?</h2>
            <p>
                Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, where the data is generated, rather than relying on a centralized data-processing warehouse or cloud. This proximity reduces latency, minimizes bandwidth usage, and improves the responsiveness of applications.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
                •	Proximity: Data processing occurs near the source of data generation.
                <br><br>•	Real-Time Processing: Enables immediate analysis and response.
                <br><br>•	Decentralization: Distributes computational load across multiple edge nodes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src = "edge_process">
            <h2>How Edge Computing Works</h2>
            <p>
                Edge computing involves a distributed architecture where processing power is decentralized and moved closer to the data source. This setup typically includes:
            </p>
            <h3>Components:</h3>
            <p>
                •	Edge Devices: These are the sensors, cameras, or other devices that generate data.
                <br><br>•	Edge Nodes: Intermediate processing units, such as routers, gateways, or local servers, that handle data processing close to the data source.
                <br><br>•	Central Cloud: While edge computing processes data locally, the central cloud is still used for storage, deeper analysis, and managing non-time-critical tasks.
            </p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
                1.	Data Generation: Edge devices generate vast amounts of data.
                <br><br>2.	Local Processing: Edge nodes perform initial processing and filtering, reducing the amount of data sent to the cloud.
                <br><br>3.	Data Transmission: Only relevant data is transmitted to the central cloud for further processing and storage.
                <br><br>4.	Actionable Insights: The processed data is then used to derive actionable insights, either locally at the edge or centrally.
