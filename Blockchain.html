            <!--Article content-->
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Blockchain and decentralized applications are at the forefront of the digital revolution. By enabling secure, transparent, and efficient transactions without intermediaries, these technologies are reshaping the way we conduct business, manage data, and interact online. This article delves into the core concepts of blockchain and dApps, highlighting their benefits, challenges, and future potential.
            </p>

            <img src = "Blockchain_explanation">
            <h2>Understanding Blockchain Technology</h2>
            <p>
                Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure and transparent record-keeping. Each block in the blockchain contains a list of transactions, and these blocks are linked together in a chronological chain. The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures that no single entity has control over the entire network, enhancing security and trust.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Components of Blockchain:</h3>
            <p>
                •	Decentralization: Unlike traditional databases, blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network where each participant has a copy of the ledger.
                <br><br>•	Immutability: Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the data.
                <br><br>•	Transparency: All transactions are visible to participants in the network, promoting accountability and trust.
            </p>
            <h3>How Blockchain words step by step:</h3>
            <p>
                1.	Transaction Initiation: A user initiates a transaction, which is broadcast to the network.
	            <br><br>2.	Validation: Network nodes validate the transaction using consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).
	            <br><br>3.	Block Creation: Validated transactions are grouped into a block and added to the existing blockchain.
	            <br><br>4.	Recording: The new block is recorded across all nodes in the network, making the transaction immutable and transparent.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>The Rise of Decentralized Applications (dApps)</h2>
            <p>
                Decentralized applications, or dApps, run on blockchain networks and utilize smart contracts to execute transactions and processes. Unlike traditional applications that rely on centralized servers, dApps operate on a decentralized network, offering enhanced security and resilience.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics of dApps:</h3>
            <p>
                •	Open Source: dApps are typically open-source, allowing developers to contribute and improve the code.
                <br><br>•	Decentralized: dApps run on a blockchain network, ensuring that no single entity controls the application.
                <br><br>•	Token-Based: dApps often use tokens for various functions, such as transaction fees, governance, and access to services.
                <br><br>•	Security: The decentralized nature and cryptographic principles of blockchain make it highly secure against hacking and fraud.
                <br><br>•	Transparency: All transactions and processes are visible on the blockchain, promoting transparency and accountability.
                <br><br>•	Efficiency: Blockchain can streamline processes by eliminating intermediaries and reducing transaction times.
                <br><br>•	Immutability: Once recorded, data on the blockchain cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of the information.
                <br><br>•	Decentralization: By removing central points of control, blockchain and dApps reduce the risk of single points of failure and censorship.
            </p>
            <br>
