            <h2>A Brief History of Linux</h2>
            <p>
                Linux was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student who aimed to develop a free, open-source alternative to the proprietary UNIX operating system. Torvalds initially released Linux as a kernel, the core part of an operating system, and invited developers worldwide to contribute to its development. This collaborative approach quickly gained momentum, leading to the creation of a full-fledged operating system with widespread community support.
