            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Cloud computing has become an integral part of modern IT infrastructure, enabling businesses to innovate and scale rapidly. From startups to large enterprises, organizations are leveraging cloud services to enhance productivity, streamline operations, and drive digital transformation. This article delves into the core concepts of cloud computing, its various models, and its impact on different sectors.

            <br>
            <img src = "cloud_explanation">
            <h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
            <p>
                Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet (“the cloud”). These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, organizations can rent computing resources on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider.

                <br><br>•	On-Demand Self-Service: Users can access computing resources as needed without human intervention from the service provider.
                <br><br>•	Broad Network Access: Services are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms.
                <br><br>•	Resource Pooling: Cloud providers use a multi-tenant model to serve multiple customers with dynamically assigned resources.
                <br><br>•	Rapid Elasticity: Resources can be quickly scaled up or down to meet changing demands.
                <br><br>•	Measured Service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use through metering, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer.

            </p>
            <br>
            <img src = "cloud_process">
            <h2>How Cloud Computing Works</h2>
            <p>
                Cloud computing operates on a virtualized environment where physical resources are abstracted and managed by the cloud provider. Users interact with cloud services through web interfaces, APIs, or dedicated applications.

                <br><br>Process:

                <br><br>1.	Request: Users request services through a cloud portal or API.
                <br><br>2.	Provisioning: The cloud provider allocates the necessary resources from its pool.
                <br><br>3.	Usage: Users access and utilize the resources as needed.
                <br><br>4.	Billing: Usage is tracked and billed based on consumption, often in a pay-as-you-go model.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src = "cloud_models">
            <h2>Cloud Computing Models</h2>
            <p>
                Cloud computing can be categorized into several models based on the service provided and the deployment method.

                <br><br>Service Models:

	            <br><br>•	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
	            <br><br>•	Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, allowing developers to build and deploy applications. Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure PaaS.
	            <br><br>•	Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. Examples: Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365, Google Workspace.

                <br><br>Deployment Models:

	            <br><br>•	Public Cloud: Services are delivered over the public internet and shared across multiple organizations.
	            <br><br>•	Private Cloud: Services are maintained on a private network and used exclusively by a single organization.
	            <br><br>•	Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
	            <br><br>•	Multi-Cloud: Utilizes multiple cloud services from different providers to avoid dependency on a single vendor.
